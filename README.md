# Woo-Product-Suggest
Woo Product Suggest allows you to offer and link a WooCommerce product to an existing product or bundle with custom notice.

There will be times when you want to sell a product that is displayed on your site but there is another version of it available with extra add-ons or new features in it for less price. For example, if you are a gift card seller you may want to offer a gift card bundle in your single product page(s) and promote that bundle with giving extra credit to your clients!

This feature could be helpful if:

* You want to promote your bundle or group product.
* You can offer premium or pro version of an existing free product.
* You want to alert your customers for a newer version of the current or discontinued product.

In additional to mentioned features, you don't need to remove your discontinued or out of stock products from your e-commerce store anymore, instead you can link them into the newer or more related version of them and most importantly keep your SEO juice safe!

You can simply boost your custom product sale or promote your new product launches!
